                        2. Notion of average. Computational problems with floating point rapresentation ( errors, catastrophical cancellation) and numerical solution ( Knuth ) ;<br>
                        3. We have n servers with m attackers. The hacker has probability p to penetrate each server. Make a graphical representation (line flat if hacker doesnâ€™t penetrate and a jump to 1 if he penetrates), try different n,m,p.
                        At time n we want to count how many reached each level.</p>

                        Illustrate formally, in the simplest possible way, why the Median is the minimum c f the sum of |x(i) - c| (sum of absolute deviations).
                        
                        Find all possible different conceptual different ways to define a "location" statistics (sometime also called "center" or "central tendency") or synthesis of a distributions.
                        Showing how the generalization of these ideas can potentially lead to infinite other definitions. <br>

                        Refine your SDE simulator to simulate a continuous time process where we can have an attack (indicated with a jump of +1) at any time with a constant rate of attack.
                        To create the approximation of time continuity subdivide your reference temporal window into numerous intervals of vanishing size dt = 1/n and to each infinitesimal 
                        interval assign a probability of a +1 "jump" (attack success) equal to Lambda * dt, where Lambda is a simulation parameter, having the meaning of expected total number of attacks in the reference period.

                        Refine your stochastic SDE simulator to generate a continuous time, process to represent the scaling limit of the random Walk.
                        To create the approximation of time continuity subdivide your reference temporal window into vanishing intervals dt 
                        and on each infinitesimal interval assign a probability p or p to make a jump of a + or - sqrt(dt).
                        Note the significance of the simulation (Donsker invariance principle/ theorem or the functional central limit theorem) in relation to the Wiener process
